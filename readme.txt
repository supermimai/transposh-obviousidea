Transposh adds best of breed translation support to wordpress, more than a 100 languages are automatically translated and can be manually corrected with ease.

== Description ==
Transposh translation filter for WordPress offers a unique approach to blog translation. It allows your blog to combine automatic translation with human translation aided by your users with an easy to use in-context interface.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.15 =
* Add native WP Rocket support for language-prefixed pages and language-scoped invalidation after real translation changes.
* Isolate dictionary caches by site and group Memcached reads in bounded batches.
* Avoid unused URL-segment prefetch when translated URLs are disabled.
* Prevent identical special-character translation saves from causing unnecessary database writes and cache invalidations.
* Handle empty HTML containers and JSON buffers without dropping header or body content.
* Preserve explicit URL language priority and existing shared-phrase invalidation.
* Include complete installable packaging and documented mirror validation. Updating the plugin does not migrate site-specific asynchronous shop prices.

= 1.0.15-rc1 (pre-release) =
* Added native WP Rocket support for canonical language-prefixed singular pages.
* Invalidate all affected-language pages after actual translation changes, including shared phrases and consent variants.
* Isolate dictionary cache keys by site and generation without flushing shared cache services.
* Fix parser prefetch maps and group Memcached reads in bounded batches.
* Keep explicit URL languages deterministic and avoid unnecessary PHP sessions.
* Reconcile Ollama, protected terms, reciprocal hreflang and scalar suggestion handling from the test mirror.
* Add reproducible packaging and cache/provider regression checks. Validated on www2 only; no production deployment.

= 1.0.14 =
* Fixed Bing source language fallback to use the site's default language instead of always forcing English.

= 1.0.13 =
* Switched Bing translations to the official Microsoft Translator API.
* Added Ollama support for manual translation review with configurable endpoint, API key, model, and prompt template.
* Added an Ollama connectivity check in the admin interface.
* Added protected terms support to preserve brand names and product names during translation.
* Added hreflang x-default output for multilingual SEO.
* Fixed Bing manual suggestion decoding for phrase-by-phrase review.
* Fixed translation editor asset versioning to avoid stale cached scripts and styles.
